The Second Page
===============

This is the code for the website of storytelling podcast [The Second Page](http://makesomethingeveryday.com/secondpage/). I've made it available so that people can see how it is possible to run a podcast using a relatively simple [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)-powered website.

Omitted from this repository are the `/_site/` directory, into which Jekyll compiles the final static version of the site and the `/media/` directory in which the podcast audio files and associated images are stored.
