  <h2>What to Share</h2>
  <p>
    Stories submitted to The Second Page should be largely true, and involve your own experiences.
    We welcome stories of all sizes (a few minutes up to half an hour). Recordings are preferred in WAV or AIF format,
    though MP3s are okay. Recordings should be read aloud by you or a friend.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you would like to contribute, but cannot read your story or prefer to remain anonymous, let us know.
    If aired, we can likely include your work under another name, and record it ourselves.
  </p>
  <h2>How to Share</h2>
  <p>
    We're pretty accomodating with regard to sending/receiving your recordings. However, we recommend
    link sharing using a service like
    <a href="drive.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Drive</a>
    or
    <a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropbox</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To send a link to your recording, or if you have other questions, email us directly at either
    <a href="mailto:harris@chromamine.com">harris@chromamine.com</a> for Harris or
    <a href="mailto:smh@seanmhanson.com">smh@seanmhanson.com</a> for Se&aacute;n.
    For sufficiently small files, you may wish to email us the file directly.
