  <h2>What to Share</h2>
  <p>
    Stories submitted to The Second Page should be largely true, and involve your own experiences (though some artistic liberty
    can be appreciated).
    We welcome stories of all sizes (a few minutes up to half an hour). Recordings are preferred in WAV or AIF format,
    though MP3s are okay. Recordings should be read aloud by you or a friend, and should be prefaced with a five second
    recorded pause, to allow us to isolate noise in the background where you are recording.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you would like to contribute, but cannot read your story or prefer to remain anonymous, let us know.
    We can include your work under another name, and record it ourselves.
  </p>
  <h2>How to Share</h2>

    We're pretty accomodating with regard to sending/receiving your recordings. However, we recommend
    link sharing using a service like
    <a href="drive.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Drive</a>
    or
    <a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropbox</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To send a link to your recording, or if you have other questions, email us directly at either

    For sufficiently small files, you may wish to email us the file directly.

  <h2>Tips on Recording</h2>
  <p>
    You don't need a professional microphone to record, though if you have one that's great. Here are some quick
    tips to help make your recording shine no matter your device:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Know your hardware options</strong>. If you have a smart phone, there are a lot of voice memo and similar
        apps out there to turn your phone into a recording booth. If you have a webcam, your webcam likely has audio
        recording capability. If you have a laptop with a built in camera, you likely can use your laptop to record as well
        though you are more likely to pick up the sounds of your laptop's fans, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Record in a high-fidelity format</strong>. We accept MP3s, but saving your recording as a WAV or AIFF
          will help a lot in preserving the quality of your recording.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Record in a quiet space</strong>. Even things like your fan, refrigerator, pet koala, can get picked
        up easily when recording.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Calibrate your recording space using headphones</strong>. Listening to your microphone through your headphones lets you determine if
        you need to move to another environment, and whether or not your volume levels are appropriate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Don't sit directly in front of your microphone</strong>. If you do, your "P" and "B" sounds will likely be
        too loud. Setting your microphone at a small angle from in front of you can help cut this down.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Muffle what's behind you</strong>. The microphone will pick up all sound that is directly behind you. While
        sitting a few feet from a wall or corner is best to cut down on background sound, muffling that area is even better.
        Draping a bedspread or quilt behind you can cut down a lot on small echoes in the room, focusing your voice more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Speak consistently</strong>. If your recording is consistent in volume, it will be easier to edit. Tell your
        story with an assertive volume; otherwise, when mixed, whispering will cause background sounds to be amplified.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
