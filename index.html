	<p>See below for upcoming themes.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Anyone may submit a story!</li>
		<li>Interpret the theme as strictly or loosely as you want.</li>
		<li>Attach a brief written bio, along the lines of &ldquo;Harris Lapiroff is an Oberlin College alumn from the class of 2011. He makes websites and art in Oberlin, Ohio.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>Aim for a story of 5 to 15 minutes. If it needs to be shorter, don't pad it. If it&#8217;s <em>really</em> fascinating, go ahead and make it longer.</li>
		<li>Record in a quiet location, to the extent available. If possible use an external microphone to avoid getting computer fan noise.</li>
		<li>Try to follow FCC regulations with respect to <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity">obscenity, indecency, and profanity</a>.</li>
