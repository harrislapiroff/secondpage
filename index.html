	<h2>Submit a Story</h2>
	<p>This week&#8217;s theme is <strong>Mistakes</strong>. Submit stories before 6PM EST on <em>Sunday, February 17th</em>.</p>
	<p>To submit a story, email an audio recording to <a href="mailto:hlapirof@oberlin.edu">hlapirof@oberlin.edu</a>.</p>
	<p>Guidelines:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Interpret the theme as strictly or loosely as you want.</li>
		<li>Aim for a story of 5 to 15 minutes. If it needs to be shorter, don't pad it. If it&#8217;s <em>really</em> fascinating, go ahead and make it longer.</li>
		<li>Record in a quiet location, to the extent available. If possible use an external microphone to avoid getting computer fan noise.</li>
		<li>Try to follow FCC regulations with respect to <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity">obscenity, indecency, and profanity</a>.</li>
		<li>Attach a brief written bio, along the lines of &ldquo;Harris Lapiroff is an Oberlin College alumn from the class of 2011. He makes websites and art in Oberlin, Ohio.&rdquo;</li>
	</ul>
