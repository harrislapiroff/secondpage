	<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
	<p>You can send us your recordings as <strong>.mp3</strong> files, but we also accept <strong>.wav</strong> and <strong>.aac</strong> files. You can email them directly to <a href="mailto:secondpagestories@gmail.com">secondpagestories@gmail.com</a> as an attachment, or you can give us a link to Dropbox or another location if the file is too large.</p>

	<p>We consider stories of all lengths, but for best results please try to keep submissions to a maximum of 10min. We also would love to hear your original songs and will of course give you credit and a plug during the podcast.</p>

	<p>You don't need a professional microphone to get a good recording, but external microphones work best if you have them (Harris is in love with his iPhone headphones for this reason). Regardless of what you have to work with, we do want to pass on some tips for making the best recording you can with whatever you have available:</p>
	<ul>
		<li class="margin-trailer"><strong>Hard surfaces aren't your friend.</strong> Your shower is a great place to sing, but not so much for recording. Soft surfaces absorb more noise, so consider spending some quality time with your closet.</li>
		<li class="margin-trailer"><strong>Avoid open spaces and keep the wall behind you.</strong> Most microphones record only in one direction, so keeping a wall or bookshelf behind you will cut down on noise. For bonus points, you can deaden the wall by hanging up your comfiest blanket.</li>
		<li class="margin-trailer"><strong>Don't record at your desk!</strong> Desks tend to build up bass frequencies and reflect noise too easily. We at The Second Page advocate emancipating yourself from your desk anyway.</li>
		<li class="margin-trailer"><strong>Record yourself about a foot away from the microphone.</strong> A little closer won't hurt, but make sure your recording isn't too loud as a result.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Finally, <strong>have fun</strong>. Some of our favorite storytelling experiences involved our friends messing up, laughing, and not taking themselves too seriously. We definitely want you to enjoy yourself!</p>
